      "- If you’d rather avoid a casserole, the Chicken Fried Rice is also very fridge-friendly: simply store leftovers in an airtight container and reheat in a skillet or microwave. It reheats quickly and doesn’t require separate components.\n",

It stores well in the fridge for 3–4 days and reheats nicely in the microwave or oven without losing texture.\\n- If you’d rather avoid a casserole, the Chicken Fried Rice is also very fridge-friendly: simply store leftovers in an airtight container and reheat in a skillet or microwave. It reheats quickly and doesn’t require separate components.\\n- The One-Pot Creamy Chicken and Rice is also convenient for fridge storage, since leftovers stay cohesive in the same pot (just reheat gently with a splash of broth to loosen if needed).\\n\\nWould you like me to share the full step-by-step recipe for the easiest option (casserole), with exact measurements and a fridge-friendly storage plan? If you tell me how many servings you want to store, I’ll tailor it.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 2800, 'prompt_tokens': 7033, 'total_tokens': 9833, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 2432, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-CsZwJN6JSjjXouJRf2XU3Nu3xbMtU', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--019b70ca-d1ab-76f3-9f44-a5c09a06e0d0-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 7033, 'output_tokens': 2800, 'total_tokens': 9833, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 2432}})]}\n"
